# Recipe Index
This is a project I created to gain some experience with GUI programming and SQL. It’s a Java based desktop application for organizing a recipe collection that supports the usual CRUD operations and has a parser for bulk adding ingredients. I probably won’t do much more with this project though I have been toying with the idea of turning it into an Android application.
